  <h1 id="#Climate">Considering the state of the climate</h1>
  <p>There are several things to reflect on:<br>
  The human condition<br>The material limits of reality<br>
  The preestablished structures of societies</p>
  <h2>The human condition</h2>
  <p>An aspect is how the layers applied to peoples' compartmentalization of concepts and ideas.<br>
  People chose what is important based on their experiences: if you hear a news story about a murder,<br>
  do you ask the gender first or the age of the killer? The socio-economic class or race? The motive <br>
  or the method? The thinking around this drives the separation, the generation of an other, by <br>
  allowing the necessary reduction of complexity for anyones capacity for attention. This further extends <br>
  into how significant any one thing is: more significant, more <i>boxes</i> one employes.</p>
